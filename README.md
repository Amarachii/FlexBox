# FlexBoxx
  This is was like my toughest project so far and it took some good time to finally understand and digest it properly.

# Challenges
  I found it hard to understand the different styled for the parent and children.
  This was my main challenge and when I got it , it made the project so much easier to understand.
  Frankly speaking now, Flexbox is easy when one calms down to really understand it.

# References
  Well Google as always was there for me when I got tangled up in confusion.
  I visited various sites that I don't even remember their names...I just wanted to find the right one with the helpful info.

# About my project
  Well this is a Flexbox project which I used to create a site for renting the right car that suites one's taste. 
  I created three cards representing three cars and a little about them and why they should be rented. 
  I made the learn more button at the bottom a link to sites where the user can actually rent a car.
